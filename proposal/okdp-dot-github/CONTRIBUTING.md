# Contributing to OKDP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OKDP!

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues on the relevant repository
- Use the provided issue templates (bug report, feature request)
- For security vulnerabilities, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

### Contributing Documentation

The helm-handbook contains two types of guides:

- **Full-stack deployment guide** (`README.md`): end-to-end installation covering all modules in order
- **Prerequisites guide** (`modules/prerequisites/README.md`): infrastructure umbrella chart and post-install steps

When contributing:
- Keep each guide focused on its scope (full-stack or prerequisites)
- Use the provided PR template
- Values files must contain real, working values — no placeholders

### Contributing Code

The workflow depends on the visibility of the target repository.

#### Public repositories (open-source contribution)

The default workflow for everyone is fork-based:

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork and create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure CI passes, if configured (lint, tests, build)
5. Submit a Pull Request from your fork to the upstream `main`

> **Maintainers only (urgent/quick fixes):** maintainers may create a branch directly in the upstream repository instead of forking, but only for time-sensitive changes. The fork-based workflow remains the default for all other contributions.

**Keeping your fork up to date:**

```sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

#### Private repositories (internal team contribution)

1. Create a branch **directly from `main`** in the repository (no fork needed)
2. Make your changes
3. Ensure CI passes, if configured (lint, tests, build)
4. Submit a Pull Request to `main`

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add OIDC support for Trino
fix: correct S3 endpoint in hive-metastore values
docs: update airflow INSTALL.md with gitSync config
chore: bump cert-manager to v1.17.1
```

### Pull Request Process

- If your work is still in progress, open a **Draft PR**. This allows early feedback and makes your work visible to the team without triggering a formal review. Convert it to a regular PR when it is ready.
- All PRs must be linked to an issue. If no relevant issue exists, open one before submitting your PR. Trivial fixes (typos, broken links) may skip this.
- Bug fixes and minor changes require at least 1 maintainer approval (lazy consensus)
- Feature PRs and documentation PRs are reviewed and approved at the **TOSIT Contributors Meeting**; plan your submissions accordingly
- All CI checks must pass
- Keep PRs focused: one concern per PR. If your PR touches multiple unrelated things, split it.
- Keep PRs under 500 lines of meaningful changes where possible. If your PR is larger, explain in the description why it cannot be split. Large PRs that are difficult to review may be sent back for splitting.
- During review, address feedback by adding new commits — do not rewrite history or force-push. This preserves reviewer context.
- Once your PR is approved, **squash your commits** into meaningful units and **rebase your branch** on top of the latest `main`. Then use `git push --force-with-lease` to update the PR before merge.
